# What is it for?
The InteractiveVideo Plugin for ILIAS gives you the possibility to create a video object, where your students can communicate in a asynchrone way. Please note that this is *NOT* a chat. They can leave notes on different timestamps in the video for other students to read, or only for themselves. Further a tutor can insert questions on various positions in the video for the students to answer. At the moment three questions types are supported single and multiple choice and a reflective type.
